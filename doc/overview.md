react.hx
========

**example-commentbox** (renamed from *demo*) closely follows the official React tutorial: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html

**example-filterproducts** roughly follows the "Thinking in React" tutorial: http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html


Changes from original react.hx:

- some minor fixes like cleaning jsx code from linebreaks (causing errors in some cases)
- hack to allow React classes to live in other than package root (see example-filterproducts)
- haxelib library dependecies are replaced with inclusion in /libs - to avoid problems with react.hx incompatibility with later tink_core 1.0.0-rc* versions

*node* and *npm* need to be installed on your machine
